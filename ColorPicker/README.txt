Core Comments
1. Home Controller loads in list of colors from local json file

Bonus Comments
1. Search by color name or hex code
2. Tints are not valid colors in the swatch list, therefore non-clickable. 
3. Group By Color works by pulling all swatched with the color in it's name. Example: red will pull indian red, palevioletred, etc.
